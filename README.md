## 🚀 Goal of the project

> [!NOTE]
> I initially developed a very basic game in 2022 and created multiple issues to encourage contributions from the community. The main goal of this repository is not just to build a game, but to provide an open-source project where everyone can contribute step by step.

## 🧑‍💻 Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be aware to download the version of [Open JDK 21](https://jdk.java.net/archive/) before installing. I bet you can download any JDK you want, it just needs to be version 21.
> Run the command `java --version` to make sure Java 21 is installed.

## 👨 Author

Initially, the project was a collaboration between three creators : Dylan, Maxime, and myself—as part of a school project at the University of Cork in 2022. However, after the semester ended, I took over full responsibility for the project, while my teammates moved on to other endeavors.
